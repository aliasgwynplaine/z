One folder is associated to one `struct kobject`

```c
struct kset {
	struct list_head list;
	spinlock_t list_lock;
	struct kobject kobj;
	const struct kset_uevent_ops *uevent_ops;
} __randomize_layout;

struct kobject {
	const char		*name;
	struct list_head	entry;
	struct kobject		*parent;
	struct kset		*kset;
	const struct kobj_type	*ktype;
	struct kernfs_node	*sd; /* sysfs directory entry */
	struct kref		kref;

	unsigned int state_initialized:1;
	unsigned int state_in_sysfs:1;
	unsigned int state_add_uevent_sent:1;
	unsigned int state_remove_uevent_sent:1;
	unsigned int uevent_suppress:1;

#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE
	struct delayed_work	release;
#endif
};
```


Those are the parent kobject:
```c
/* The global /sys/kernel/ kobject for people to chain off of */
extern struct kobject *kernel_kobj;
/* The global /sys/kernel/mm/ kobject for people to chain off of */
extern struct kobject *mm_kobj;
/* The global /sys/hypervisor/ kobject for people to chain off of */
extern struct kobject *hypervisor_kobj;
/* The global /sys/power/ kobject for people to chain off of */
extern struct kobject *power_kobj;
/* The global /sys/firmware/ kobject for people to chain off of */
extern struct kobject *firmware_kobj;
```
